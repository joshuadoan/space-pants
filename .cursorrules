# Space Pants - Cursor Rules

## Game Description

Space Pants is a real-time space economy simulation game built with React, TypeScript, and Excalibur.js. The game features autonomous entities (miners, traders, space stations, space bars, space apartments, asteroids, treasure collectors, and a player) that interact in a dynamic space economy. Entities follow customizable behavior rules that determine their actions based on resource conditions (ore, money, products). Players can observe the simulation, control a player character, edit entity rules, and watch the economy evolve in real-time.

## State Management: Prefer useReducer and Actions

- **Always use `useReducer` for component state management** instead of `useState` when state has multiple related values or complex update logic
- **Define action types as discriminated unions** with a `type` field and optional `payload` field
- **Use descriptive action type names** in kebab-case (e.g., `"set-active-tab"`, `"zoom-to-entity"`)
- **Keep reducers pure functions** - they should only compute new state based on the current state and action, no side effects
- **Define action types separately** before the reducer function for better type safety
- **Example pattern:**
  ```typescript
  type SetValueAction = {
    type: "set-value";
    payload: string;
  };
  
  type Action = SetValueAction | OtherAction;
  
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer((state: State, action: Action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case "set-value":
        return { ...state, value: action.payload };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  }, initialState);
  ```

## Component Library: DaisyUI

- **Use DaisyUI components** for all UI elements - it's built on top of TailwindCSS
- **Common DaisyUI components to use:**
  - `card`, `card-body` for card layouts
  - `badge`, `badge-sm`, `badge-outline` for badges
  - `tabs`, `tabs-boxed`, `tab`, `tab-active` for tab navigation
  - `navbar` for navigation bars
  - `divider` for section separators
  - `btn`, `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary` for buttons
  - `input`, `select`, `textarea` for form elements
- **Use TailwindCSS utility classes** for styling and spacing
- **DaisyUI theme classes:** Use `base-content`, `base-100`, `base-200`, `base-300` for theme-aware colors
- **Color variants:** `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error` for semantic colors
- **Reference:** Check existing components like `MeepleCard.tsx` and `Tabs.tsx` for usage patterns

## Icon Library: @tabler/icons-react

- **Use icons from `@tabler/icons-react`** package (version 3.35.0)
- **Import icons individually** - each icon is a named export (e.g., `IconRocket`, `IconUser`, `IconShip`)
- **Icons follow the pattern:** `Icon[Name]` in PascalCase
- **Common icons used in the project:**
  - `IconRocket` - main game icon
  - `IconUser` - player/user
  - `IconShip` - trader/ship
  - `IconPick` - miner
  - `IconMeteor` - asteroid
  - `IconSatellite` - space station
  - `IconBeer` - space bar
  - `IconBuilding` - space apartments
  - `IconStar` - treasure collector
  - `IconCurrencyDollar` - money/trading
  - `IconMoodSmile` - idle/chilling
  - `IconUsers` - socializing/visitors
  - `IconArrowUp`, `IconArrowDown`, `IconArrowLeft`, `IconArrowRight` - directions
- **Icon sizing:** Use the `size` prop (e.g., `<IconUser size={14} />`) - common sizes are 14, 16, 28
- **Icon styling:** Icons accept className prop for TailwindCSS classes (e.g., `className="text-primary"`)
- **Example usage:**
  ```typescript
  import { IconRocket } from "@tabler/icons-react";
  
  <IconRocket size={28} className="text-primary" />
  ```

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all files
- Use functional React components with hooks
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions and types
