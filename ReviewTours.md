**Source:** https://www.codesee.io/interactive-code-tours  
**Note:** This page may soon be gone. Information captured on January 9, 2026.

## Overview

CodeSee Interactive Code Tours is a feature that allows developers to visually walk others through their codebase and code changes. The platform helps make async walkthroughs of codebases and code changes easy.

## Key Features

### Main Value Proposition
- **Visually walk others through your code** - Walk people through exactly what change you made, how it works and why
- **Make async walkthroughs easy** - Interactive Code Tours bring your codebase to life and can be customized for different collaborators and by task
- **Stay up to date** - As your codebase map changes, CodeSee alerts viewers if steps in your tour no longer apply

### Core Capabilities

1. **Walk through areas of your code**
   - Walk teammates through features, refactors, tricky bits, gotchas and more

2. **Explain your code changes**
   - Visually walk your code reviewers through your PR
   - Show how to complete your code review
   - Explain why you made the change the way you did

3. **Tours are connected to your code**
   - Tours will notify you when they are out of date
   - Alerts viewers if steps in your tour no longer apply

## Problem It Solves

- **Walking others through your code is awkward** - Code is dispersed everywhere making walk throughs hard
- **Documentation gets outdated** - Once you make a walk through it's almost immediately out of date
